ctwin32 is a pure Python module, that wraps some Windows APIs (win32) by using
[ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html). Since it is my personal
playground, the selection of supported APIs and the way those are wrapped are
solely dictated by my needs and preferences.

ctwin32 is *__definitely__* not a replacement for
[pywin32](https://pypi.org/project/pywin32/), although it serves that purpose
for me (in conjunction with [comtypes](https://pypi.org/project/comtypes/)).
Compared with pywin32 the coverage of ctwin32 is downright tiny.

See the
[samples directory](https://github.com/RoccoMatano/ctwin32/tree/master/samples)
for several instances of how ctwin32 can be used.

Note: Even though ctwin32 is a pure Python module, it can of course only be used
on Windows. Therefore, the
[wheel packages provided](https://pypi.org/project/ctwin32/#files)
are intentionally tagged with the x86, x64 and and arm64 Windows platform tags
(in terms of content, those are the same). This is just to keep
[pip](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/)
from installing them on a non-Windows OS.
